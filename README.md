# 🌙 Oru

> A privacy-first freelance marketplace on [Midnight](https://midnight.network) — work orders whose details, budgets, and identities stay off the public ledger.

Built for the **Monthly Moonshots on Midnight** builder program. Current level: **Level 2 — Waxing Crescent** 🌒

## Live Demo

**[oru-web-beta.vercel.app](https://oru-web-beta.vercel.app/)**

Requires a Lace wallet set to Preprod and a local Midnight proof server on `localhost:6300` — see the note in ["Deploy the Frontend"](#deploy-the-frontend).

## Contract Address

| Preview | _not deployed_ |

## What This Does

Oru is an on-chain registry for freelance work orders. A client posts a job; a freelancer accepts it; the client marks it complete (or cancels it while it's still open). The twist is *what the chain gets to see*: the public ledger stores only the order's lifecycle status and cryptographic commitments. The job description, the budget, and the real identities of both parties never appear on-chain — yet the contract still enforces the rules ("only the client can complete this order", "you can't accept your own job") inside zero-knowledge circuits, and any committed value can later be *proven* without being revealed.

The Level 1 contract ([contract/src/oru.compact](contract/src/oru.compact)) has 5 circuits: `postOrder`, `acceptOrder`, `completeOrder`, `cancelOrder`, and `verifyBudget`.

## Privacy Model

- **What is PUBLIC (on-chain, visible to anyone):**
  - The order counter and each order's lifecycle status (`OPEN → ASSIGNED → COMPLETED/CANCELLED`)
  - Commitments only: a SHA-256 hash of the job details, a salted hash of the budget, and identity hashes for client/freelancer
- **What is PRIVATE (private witness, never on-chain):**
  - `localSecretKey` — each participant's 32-byte secret key, supplied at proof time by their own machine ([witnesses.ts](contract/src/witnesses.ts)) and used only *inside* the circuit
  - The plaintext job details, the budget amount, and the budget salt — these exist only on the client's device
- **What the user PROVES without revealing:**
  - *"I am this order's client"* — by re-deriving the identity hash from the secret key in-circuit (`completeOrder`/`cancelOrder`), with no signature or wallet address exposed
  - *"I am not the client"* — freelancers prove they aren't self-dealing when accepting (`acceptOrder`)
  - *"The budget I claim matches what was committed"* — `verifyBudget` checks a claimed amount + salt against the on-chain commitment without the ledger ever storing the amount

### Public state vs private witness

- **Public ledger state** — everything declared with `export ledger` in [oru.compact](contract/src/oru.compact): replicated on every node, visible to anyone.
- **Private witness** — the `witness localSecretKey(): Bytes<32>` declaration: caller-supplied data used inside the ZK circuit that never leaves the device.
- **The `disclose()` boundary** — circuit parameters are private by default, and the compiler *refuses to compile* any flow where witness-derived data reaches the ledger without an explicit `disclose()`. Every disclosure in Oru is a deliberate, reviewable decision — see the `disclose(...)` calls in `postOrder` and friends.

## Privacy Claim

When you post a work order through the frontend, an on-chain observer (anyone querying the Preprod indexer) sees only:

- That *some* order was posted, its sequential id, and its lifecycle status (`OPEN`, `ASSIGNED`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`)
- A SHA-256 commitment of the job details, and a salted commitment of the budget — both indistinguishable from random 32-byte values without the corresponding preimage
- Identity hashes for the client and freelancer — never a wallet address, and unlinkable across orders without knowing the underlying secret key

What that same observer **cannot** see: the job title or description in plaintext, the budget amount, the budget salt, either party's wallet address, or either party's local secret key. The zero-knowledge proof generated for every circuit call — orchestrated in-browser and computed by a local Midnight proof server — attests that the poster correctly computed those commitments and satisfied the contract's rules — *without* transmitting the private inputs that went into that computation. The frontend enforces this at the UI level too: private inputs (job details, budget, salt) are only ever held in local component state and passed directly into the circuit call — they are never rendered, logged, or included in any displayed transaction result.

## Tech Stack

- **Midnight network** (Preprod / Preview) — privacy-first blockchain
- **Compact** — Midnight's zero-knowledge circuit language (compiler 0.31.1 via compact devtools 0.5.1)
- **TypeScript** — contract bindings, tests (vitest), and deploy CLI (`@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js` 4.x + wallet SDK)
- **React + Vite** — the Level 2 frontend ([web/](web))
- **Midnight.js SDK + DApp Connector API** — browser wallet integration; circuit proofs are generated by a local Midnight proof server (`httpClientProofProvider` → `localhost:6300`)
- **Lace wallet** — wallet connect/disconnect, transaction balancing, and submission (Lace also proves the balancing step against a local proof server)
- **Node.js ≥ 22**, npm workspaces
- **Docker** — local proof server (`midnightntwrk/proof-server`), used by the CLI only — the frontend proves via the wallet, no local proof server needed

## Frontend (Level 2)

The [web/](web) package is a React + Vite dApp that connects to the deployed Preprod contract above through the Lace wallet's DApp Connector.

- **Wallet connect/disconnect** — [WalletConnect.tsx](web/src/components/WalletConnect.tsx) detects injected wallets under `window.midnight`, connects, and surfaces connection errors (wallet not installed, request rejected, permission denied).
- **Circuit call** — [CircuitCall.tsx](web/src/components/CircuitCall.tsx) posts a work order by calling `postOrder`. The job details and budget are captured in local component state, passed straight into the circuit call, and never rendered — only the returned order id, transaction id, and block height are shown, alongside a **"Proved without revealing your input"** label.
- **Provider wiring** — [useMidnight.ts](web/src/hooks/useMidnight.ts) and [lib/wallet.ts](web/src/lib/wallet.ts) bridge the wallet's connector API to midnight-js's provider interfaces: proving is delegated to the wallet (`dappConnectorProofProvider`), the indexer is read from the wallet's own configuration (respecting the user's node/indexer preferences), and private state is kept in browser `IndexedDB` via `levelPrivateStateProvider`.

Since the DApp Connector never exposes the wallet's seed to the page (by design), the browser derives its Oru marketplace secret key from the wallet's shielded coin public key instead of the raw seed the CLI uses — see [lib/contract.ts](web/src/lib/contract.ts#L23).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 22 and npm
- [Lace wallet](https://www.lace.io/) browser extension, set to Preprod, funded with tNight (for the frontend)
- Docker (for the local proof server, required only by the CLI to deploy/interact)
- [Compact developer tools](https://docs.midnight.network/getting-started/installation):
  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/latest/download/compact-installer.sh | sh
  compact update
  ```

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gbangbolaoluwagbemiga/oru.git
cd oru
npm install
npm run compact      # compile the Compact contract (generates ZK circuits + keys + TS API)
npm run build        # build both packages
```

## Run Tests

```sh
npm test             # 10 simulator-based tests covering the full order lifecycle
```

## Run the Frontend Locally

```sh
npm run compact                     # generate contract/src/managed/oru (skip if already present)
npm run build --workspace @oru/contract
npm run dev --workspace web         # http://localhost:5173
```

Open the app, connect Lace (set to Preprod), and post a work order — the `VITE_ORU_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in [web/.env.example](web/.env.example) already points at the deployed contract above. See [web/](web) for the component/hook breakdown.

## Deploy to Preprod

```sh
# Terminal 1 — proof server (or use `npm run preprod-ps --workspace cli` to auto-start it)
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:8.0.3 -- midnight-proof-server -v

# Terminal 2 — interactive CLI
npm run preprod --workspace cli
```

The CLI walks you through:

1. Creating or restoring a wallet (fund it with tNight from the [Preprod faucet](https://faucet.preprod.midnight.network/))
2. Registering NIGHT UTXOs for DUST generation (DUST pays transaction fees)
3. Deploying the Oru contract (or joining an existing one by address)
4. Posting, browsing, accepting, completing, and cancelling work orders — each action generates a real ZK proof

## Deploy the Frontend

The frontend deploys as a static site (Vercel/Netlify). [vercel.json](vercel.json) at the repo root builds the `contract` workspace first (so `@oru/contract`'s compiled output exists), then `web`:

```sh
npm install -g vercel
vercel link          # first time only
vercel --prod
```

Or on Netlify, point the build command at `npm run build --workspace @oru/contract && npm run build --workspace @oru/web` with publish directory `web/dist`. Either way, the deployed site must connect to the Preprod contract address above — set `VITE_ORU_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` as an environment variable on the hosting platform if you deploy a fork with a different address.

> **Note — proof server required.** Midnight generates ZK proofs against a **local proof server**, so anyone running the live demo (or a judge reproducing it) must have one on `localhost:6300`. Start it with `docker run -d -p 6300:6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:8.0.3 'midnight-proof-server -v'` (Lace surfaces the same requirement in-wallet). Override the URL with `VITE_PROOF_SERVER_URL` if you host one elsewhere. Fees are paid in **DUST**, which your wallet only generates after you **designate NIGHT** for DUST generation in Lace.

## Initial Idea

Oru is a freelance marketplace where the deal is on-chain but the details are not. Clients post work orders whose title, description, and budget exist on the public ledger only as cryptographic commitments; freelancers accept and deliver under pseudonymous identities derived in-circuit from local secret keys, so no wallet address is ever linked to an engagement. Rates, client lists, and work history — the data that today's freelance platforms expose to everyone including competitors — stay private, yet remain *provable*: any party can selectively disclose a committed value (like a budget) with a zero-knowledge proof when a dispute or an audit demands it. Later phases add private escrow and privately-computed reputation, giving freelancers in markets like Nigeria a way to build verifiable track records without publishing their income to the world.

[PLACEHOLDER — I will add the link after recording]

Recording checklist: connect Lace wallet (address appears on screen) → call `postOrder` (show the proof-generation loading state) → show the on-chain result (order id, transaction id) → point out the private input was never shown. Full checklist in [docs/SUBMISSION-LEVEL2.md](docs/SUBMISSION-LEVEL2.md#demo-video-checklist-under-2-minutes).
